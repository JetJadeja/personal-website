        <p>
          Iâ€™m a freshman at the USC Iovine and Young Academy, working at the
          intersection of engineering, design, and business. My focus is on
          building projects that challenge the status quo, creating spaces that
          connect and inspire, and exploring the intersection of technology and
          human connection.

          I started learning to code when I was 10, and I've been building
          projects ever since. Over the last few years, however, I've taken a
          break from work. I've focused more on the human experience. I've
          learned to appreciate art and fashion, and I've enjoyed the moment and
          the journey.
